# Crossing Borders and Senses: Developing an Audio Tactile Globe
This project was developed with students from Universidad Militar Nueva Granada in Bogota, Colombia. The project's client was Ontario College of Art & Design University and the primary purpose of this project was to help blind and low vision users learn the Earthâ€™s geography. The idea was to make it as interactive as possible so that anyone can use it. 
As a result, if we developed a final finished product, with a lot of geographical information, it could be used as a learning aid for everyone.

Unfortunately there is no demo for this project as it requires a special 3D printed globe with sensors and a Vive tracker.

You can check the VR Unity scene via YouTube:

Unity Side: Audio recordings are triggered when the user either looks at an entity or touches a sensor. The audio is played as if it is coming from the globe, giving the user a 3D audio feedback.
To determine what the user is looking at, a virtual line is drawn from the headset to a distance directly in front of the headset. The line will return different parameters if it is colliding with another object.

Adruino Side (Haptics Development): The design of the Arduino project was based on a push - button circuit made using tinkercad. Then the capacitive sensors were connected to the Arduino board in order to get analog data from the action of touching the sensors.
